"""Unit tests for the Presidio-based detection engine.

The `engine` fixture (tests/conftest.py) loads the real spaCy model once
per test session - these are deliberately not mocked, since the whole
point is to catch regressions in real detection accuracy, which is
exactly what silently broke in the previous hand-rolled implementation.
